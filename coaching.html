        <h1>My Coaching Career </h1>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
      

            <h5> Personal Sessions</h5>
<p> I have been providing personal one-on-one and group coaching for the past two years for local players. It is something that I really enjoy and I believe has a lot of value to my players. I have worked with kids between ages 6 and 15 and can adjust my sessions to make the most out of each player's skill level. This is something I really enjoy and I would love to gain some more clients!</p>

            <h5> Gitchi Gummi Soccer Club</h5>
<p> Through Gitch Soccer, I have had the opportunity to be the Assistant Coach to both Morgan McClean and my dad, Barry Chastey. I have learned a lot by learning from two of the top coaches in the area. I was Mo’s assistant for the U14 boys team that was promoted to Premier last year and helped out with my dad’s U18 Premier boys team. I have also been a part of the Youth Development Program and a coach for the Indoor Soccer League in Proctor. </p>

            <h5> My Lfie and Soccer</h5>
<p> In addition to these more formal coaching experiences, the thing that contributed most to my soccer knowledge is the fact that I have been around the game my whole life. From watching my dad’s CSS team to the countless hours on the couch watching Premier League soccer, I have been building my knowledge all my life. I hope to share some of that with the people I coach and pass on the love for the game.</p>
