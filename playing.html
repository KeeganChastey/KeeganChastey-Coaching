        <h1>My Playing Career
        </h1>
        <h3> Career Highlights</h3>
<h5> Youth Career </h5>
<p> I have played soccer since I could walk, and began playing competitively in 2009 for Gitch. This was the beginning of a special team that created unbelievable memories throughout the next 10 years of my life. We were a very successful team that played at the highest level of MN Youth Soccer. I also played for Denfeld High School where we created another great atmosphere of fun and success, taking home 3 of the 5 section titles during my time on varsity. I made the All-State Team 3 times as well as receiving a Mr. Soccer nomination and a spot on The Great Lakes Regional Team. </p>
   
<h5> CSS Men's Soccer</h5>
<p> Due to the Covid-19 situation, I was able to play the Spring semester of my senior year of high school at the College of St. Scholastica. This was a big step up for me, going from high school and youth soccer straight into the collegiate level. It was great working with my dad at a new level and I had a good year personally, making First-Team All Conference. </p>

<h5> Duluth FC </h5>
<p> In the Summer of 2021 I was a part of the Duluth FC NPSL team that made it to the first round of the Regional Playoffs. This was a great experience for me as I played with Division I and II players from all around the country. </p>
